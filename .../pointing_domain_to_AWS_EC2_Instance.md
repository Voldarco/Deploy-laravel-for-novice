# Altschool Africa

## Mini-project

### In this exercise I use namecheap from my github-student pack to access a free domain name and Aws EC2 Instance. 

### This exercises is to document how to link your laravel project to a domain and connect using route 53 on Aws.

Much thanks to @Ceo_going_through_a_lot and @the_flower_pot_guy for making this possible with their assistance. 

## Getting started. 

#### for the free domain

First of all as an Altschool student you need to register
on github student pack under Altschool. Once you do this you'll be given a student developer pack. 

You can the go the this link <a href="https://education.github.com/experiences/virtual_event_kit">here</a> and check out the name cheap option.

**Note:** Only .me domains are free and you only get one so pick the name you want knowing you can't change it for at least a year. 

After you've secured the domain. You need to go to namecheap website and login in then visit your dashboard and checkout this tab.
