## **Getting Started**

## **Step One:**

We will be using Debain 11 on a virtual machine instance with Amazon Web Services (AWS) as our VPC provider.

**NOTE:**   this should take 6min. 

- Create a new key pair if you don't have one or select an existing one. Just note where the new key pair 
is downloaded.

Next set your security to allow port **22** for SSH and 0 - 65535 for All TCP

Once you have this set you can launch the instance. click on connect instance and copy the "Example ssh"

Open your terminal and **cd into** where you have the downloaded key pair. Paste the **"ssh"** (for me it is download)and Enter. You will be logged in.
